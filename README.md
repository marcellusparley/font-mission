Me stumbling my way through learning things and making a cli game using ncurses.

## To try it out

1. Get ncurses
2. `make`
3. ???
4. it works?

## Things I kinda plan on doing

* Height values for the map (mostly just to use for damage calculation)
* Damage calculation
* Some kind of turn system
* Figure out what kind of turn system I want
* Simple Enemy AI
* Refactor the way I handle inputs
* Maybe change things about the map system
* and other shit
